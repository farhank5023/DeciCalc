# DeciCalc made using Html, CSS and JavaScript.

What makes it different from other calculators out there?<br>
-Well, I challenged myself with problems to test myself, like for example :<br>
1)Instead of accepting just numbers, it accepts alphanumeric keys but checks whether number or not then only works with numbers.<br>
2)Added a non-editable result button that is locked up to 4 decimal places.<br>
3)Made my own test cases to check the functionality of individual elements and gave a score if passing each test.<br><br>

Thankyou.
